## Intermediate React Workshop

This workshop assumes you are already comfortable with:

* The fundamentals of JavaScript -  you can write a function, understand what return does, can pass variables around an application.
**Don't sweat it if:** you sometimes goof up some of the new ES6 stuff or get clammy hands when asked to explain `this` - we can help you through that stuff if you get stuck
* React Basics - You can template an application in JSX, you understand the difference between State and Props, can write required PropTypes and are comfortable with the ES6 class extending syntax to create a component.
**Don't Sweat it if** you aren't totally sure what a Higher Order Component, Render Props, or a stateless functional component is
* You are comfortable with your development tools - you can npm install any dependency you need and you have no trouble moving around your text editor.


This workshop will help you solidify your Knowledge in React.js and learn some intermediate concepts that will help you with your day-to-day building of applications. While building an application together we will touch upon:

* The HOC design pattern
* The Render Prop design pattern
* Working with asynchronous requests to fetch data for state
* Creating a Server Side Rendered application with Next.js
* Styling our components with Next.js
* Working with new React.js APIs such as the Context API
* Learning how to handle forms and inputs in React that are tied to state
* Working with external React libraries such as Downshift for dropdowns

You should come to this workshop with:

* A laptop computer
* Chrome or Firefox with React Dev Tools Installed
* The latest version of Node.js installed
* A terminal application - the one built into your computer is just fine
* A text editor setup for React development

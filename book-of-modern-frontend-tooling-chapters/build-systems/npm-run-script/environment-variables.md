# Environment Variables

###### Fields listed in `package.json` are exported into the environment for any `npm run script-name` invocations. The name of the environment variable is generated by concatenating `npm_package_` with the name of the field. Given a field name `name`, the corresponding environment variable would be `$npm_package_name`. Correspondingly, npm configuration is exported with a prefix of `npm_config_`; for example `npm_config_email`.

# Getting Started

###### This guide assumes you have Node.js properly installed.

## Installation

While the default installation of Node.js provides `npm`, it is usually an out-of-date version of `npm`. `npm` can be upgraded as shown below:

    % npm install npm@latest --global

## Create a `package.json` file

    % npm init
